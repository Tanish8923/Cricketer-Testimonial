âœ¨ Circular Sliders and Random Picks: A React Journey with Cricketer Testimonial âœ¨

Excited to share my latest React projectâ€”**Cricketer Testimonial**, a dynamic testimonial slider showcasing reviews with some exciting features:

ðŸ”¹ **Data Management and Props Usage**:
   - Reviews are stored in a `data.js` file and passed as **props** to the **Testimonial** component.
   - The **Card** component receives a single review based on the current index, ensuring modularity and clarity.

ðŸ”¹ **Circular Navigation**:
   - Using **useState**, I implemented a **circular slider** where users can navigate through testimonials seamlessly with left and right buttons.

ðŸ”¹ **"Surprise Me" Button**:
   - Added a **randomizer feature** that picks and displays a random testimonial, adding an element of surprise and fun.

ðŸ”¹ **Styling with Tailwind CSS**:
   - Leveraged **Tailwind CSS** for modern and efficient styling, ensuring a visually appealing user interface.

ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced UI with react-icons**:
   - Leveraged **react-icons** for smooth navigation with intuitive button designs.

Building **Cricketer Testimonial** was a rewarding experience, allowing me to dive deeper into **props**, **state management**, and enhancing user interactions with React. ðŸš€

Looking forward to adding more interactive elements in future projects!
